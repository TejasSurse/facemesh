# Real-Time Face Mesh Detection Using React and TensorFlow.js

## Overview

This project demonstrates real-time facial landmark detection using TensorFlow.js and the FaceMesh model, rendered in a React application. It captures video from a webcam, processes the video frames to detect facial landmarks, and draws a triangular mesh over the detected facial features.

## Features

- **Real-Time Facial Landmark Detection:** Utilizes the TensorFlow.js FaceMesh model to detect over 400 facial landmarks.
- **Dynamic Mesh Rendering:** Renders a triangular mesh over the detected facial landmarks using an HTML5 canvas.
- **Interactive Visualization:** The detected facial points and mesh are displayed in real-time as the user interacts with the webcam.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install react-webcam @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/facemesh
   ```

3. **Start the Application:**
   Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will start on `localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- **App.js:** The main component where the webcam and canvas are set up. It also handles the detection loop using the FaceMesh model.
- **utilities.js:** Contains the `drawMesh` function responsible for drawing the triangular mesh and points on the canvas.

## Code Explanation

1. **Setup Webcam and Canvas:** 
   - A webcam feed is captured using the `react-webcam` package.
   - An HTML5 canvas is placed over the webcam feed to draw the mesh.

2. **Facemesh Loading:**
   - The FaceMesh model is loaded using TensorFlow.js. This model processes the video frames and estimates facial landmarks.

3. **Detection Function:**
   - The `detect` function continuously captures video frames from the webcam, performs facial landmark detection, and draws the corresponding mesh on the canvas.

4. **Drawing Utilities:**
   - The `drawPath` function in `utilities.js` creates the triangular paths for the mesh.
   - The `drawMesh` function uses these paths to draw triangles and points on the detected facial landmarks.

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional facial analysis features, such as emotion detection or face recognition.
- Optimize the performance for low-end devices.
- Add support for mobile devices.

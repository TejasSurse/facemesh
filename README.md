## 📜 Overview

This project demonstrates real-time **facial landmark detection** using **TensorFlow.js** and the **FaceMesh** model, rendered in a React application. It captures video from a webcam, processes the video frames to detect facial landmarks, and draws a triangular mesh over the detected facial features.

## ✨ Features

- 🕵️ **Real-Time Facial Landmark Detection:** Utilizes the TensorFlow.js FaceMesh model to detect over 400 facial landmarks.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Mesh Rendering:** Renders a triangular mesh over the detected facial landmarks using an HTML5 canvas.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Visualization:** The detected facial points and mesh are displayed in real-time as the user interacts with the webcam.

## 🚀 Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install react-webcam @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/facemesh
   ```

3. **Start the Application:**
   Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will start on `localhost:3000`.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- **App.js:** The main component where the webcam and canvas are set up. It also handles the detection loop using the FaceMesh model.
- **utilities.js:** Contains the `drawMesh` function responsible for drawing the triangular mesh and points on the canvas.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Explanation

1. **🎥 Setup Webcam and Canvas:** 
   - A webcam feed is captured using the `react-webcam` package.
   - An HTML5 canvas is placed over the webcam feed to draw the mesh.

2. **📦 Facemesh Loading:**
   - The FaceMesh model is loaded using TensorFlow.js. This model processes the video frames and estimates facial landmarks.

3. **🔍 Detection Function:**
   - The `detect` function continuously captures video frames from the webcam, performs facial landmark detection, and draws the corresponding mesh on the canvas.

4. **✏️ Drawing Utilities:**
   - The `drawPath` function in `utilities.js` creates the triangular paths for the mesh.
   - The `drawMesh` function uses these paths to draw triangles and points on the detected facial landmarks.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- 🤖 Implement additional facial analysis features, such as emotion detection or face recognition.
- ⚙️ Optimize the performance for low-end devices.
- 📱 Add support for mobile devices.
